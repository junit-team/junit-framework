=== JUnit Platform Suite Engine

The Suite Engine supports the declarative selection and execution of tests from
_any_ test engine using the JUnit Platform.

[[junit-platform-suite-engine-setup]]
==== Setup

In addition to the `junit-platform-suite-api` and `junit-platform-suite-engine` artifacts,
you need _at least one_ other test engine and its dependencies on the classpath. See
<<dependency-metadata>> for details regarding group IDs, artifact IDs, and versions.

[[junit-platform-suite-engine-setup-required-dependencies]]
===== Required Dependencies

* `junit-platform-suite-api` in _test_ scope: artifact containing annotations needed to
  configure a test suite
* `junit-platform-suite-engine` in _test runtime_ scope: implementation of the
  `TestEngine` API for declarative test suites

NOTE: Both of the required dependencies are aggregated in the `junit-platform-suite`
artifact which can be declared in _test_ scope instead of declaring explicit dependencies
on `junit-platform-suite-api` and `junit-platform-suite-engine`.

[[junit-platform-suite-engine-setup-transitive-dependencies]]
===== Transitive Dependencies

* `junit-platform-launcher` in _test_ scope
* `junit-platform-engine` in _test_ scope
* `junit-platform-commons` in _test_ scope
* `opentest4j` in _test_ scope

==== @Suite Example

By annotating a class with `@Suite` it is marked as a test suite on the JUnit Platform.
As seen in the following example, selector and filter annotations can then be used to
control the contents of the suite.

.Additional Configuration Options
NOTE: There are numerous configuration options for discovering and filtering tests in a
test suite. Please consult the Javadoc of the `{suite-api-package}` package for a full
list of supported annotations and further details.

.Duplicate test execution
NOTE: Tests in a suite are executed in addition to the tests executed by every other test
engine, so it is possible to for the same test to be executed twice. A common solution is
to use a naming pattern. Name all suites `*Suite` and all tests `*Test` and configure your
build tool to only include the former. Alternatively, consider
<<running-tests-tags, using tags>> to select specific groups of tests.

==== @BeforeSuite and @AfterSuite

`@BeforeSuite` and `@AfterSuite` annotations can be used on methods inside a
`@Suite`-annotated class. They will be executed respectively before and after
all tests of the test suite.
