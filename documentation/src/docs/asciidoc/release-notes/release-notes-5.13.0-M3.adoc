=== Overall Changes

[[release-notes-5.13.0-M3-overall-new-features-and-improvements]]
==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The JUnit feature in GraalVM Native Build Tools has been rewritten to no longer require
  JUnit classes to be initialized at build time. Therefore, JUnit's JARs no longer ship
  with `native-image.properties` files that contain `--initialize-at-build-time` options
  (introduced in 5.12.0). Please update to the most recent version of GraalVM Native Build
  Tools prior to upgrading to this version of JUnit.

==== New Features and Improvements

* Introduce resource management mechanism that allows preparing and sharing state across
  executions or test engines via stores that are scoped to a `LauncherSession` or
  `ExecutionRequest`. The Jupiter API uses these stores as ancestors to the `Store`
  instances accessible via `ExtensionContext` and provides a new method to access them
  directly. Please refer to the User Guide for examples of managing
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#launcher-api-launcher-session-listeners-tool-example-usage, session-scoped>>
  and
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#launcher-api-managing-state-across-test-engines, request-scoped>>
  resources.
* Introduce a mechanism for `TestEngine` implementations to report issues encountered
  during test discovery. If an engine reports a `DiscoveryIssue` with a `Severity` equal
  to or higher than a configurable critical severity, its tests will not be executed.
  Instead, the engine will be reported as failed during execution with a failure message
  listing all critical issues. Non-critical issues will be logged but will not prevent the
  engine from executing its tests. The critical severity can be configured via a new
  configuration parameter and, currently, defaults to `ERROR`. Please refer to the
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#running-tests-discovery-issues, User Guide>> for details.
+
If you're a test engine maintainer, please see the
<<../user-guide/index.adoc#test-engines-discovery-issues, User Guide>> for details on how
to start reporting discovery issues.
* Start reporting discovery issues for problematic `@Suite` classes:
  - Invalid `@Suite` class declarations (for example, when `private`)
  - Invalid `@BeforeSuite`/`@AfterSuite` method declarations (for example, when not
    `static`)
  - Cyclic dependencies between `@Suite` classes

==== New Features and Improvements

* Start reporting discovery issues for potentially problematic test classes:
    - Invalid `@Test` and `@TestTemplate` method declarations (for example, when return
      type is not `void`)
    - Invalid `@TestFactory` methods (for example, when return type is invalid)
    - Multiple method-level annotations (for example, `@Test` and `@TestTemplate`)
    - Invalid test class and `@Nested` class declarations (for example, `static` `@Nested`
      classes)
    - Potentially missing `@Nested` annotations (for example, non-abstract inner classes
      that contain test methods)
    - Invalid lifecycle method declarations (for example, when `private`)
    - Invalid `@Tag` syntax
    - Blank `@DisplayName` declarations
    - Blank `@SentenceFragment` declarations
    - `@BeforeParameterizedClassInvocation` and `@AfterParameterizedClassInvocation`
      methods declared in non-parameterized test classes
* By default, `AutoCloseable` objects put into `ExtensionContext.Store` are now treated
  like instances of `CloseableResource` (which has been deprecated) and are closed
  automatically when the store is closed at the end of the test lifecycle. It's possible
  to <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-keeping-state-autocloseable-support, revert to the old behavior>>
  via a configuration parameter. Please also see the
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-keeping-state-autocloseable-migration, migration note>>
  for third-party extensions wanting to support both JUnit 5.13 and earlier versions.

* `java.util.Locale` arguments are now converted according to the IETF BCP 47 language tag
  format. See the
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-argument-conversion-implicit, User Guide>>
  for details.
