[[release-notes-5.13.1-junit-jupiter-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* The 5.13.0 release introduced a regression regarding the execution order in test classes
  containing both test methods and `@Nested` test classes. When classpath scanning was
  used during test discovery -- for example, when resolving a package selector for a
  `@Suite` class -- test methods in `@Nested` classes were executed _before_ test methods
  in their enclosing class. This undesired change in behavior has now been reverted so
  that tests in `@Nested` test classes are always executed _after_ tests in enclosing test
  classes again.
* Fix support for `AnnotationBasedArgumentsProvider` implementations that override the
  deprecated `provideArguments(ExtensionContext, Annotation)` method.
