[[release-notes-6.0.0-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

[[release-notes-6.0.0-junit-platform-deprecations-and-breaking-changes]]
==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* Support for running the `ConsoleLauncher` without specifying a subcommand has been
  removed.
* Support for non-conventional `ConsoleLauncher` options such as `--h` (rather than `-h`)
  or `-help` (rather than `--help`) has been removed.
* The `junit-platform-runner` module which provided the JUnit 4 based `JUnitPlatform`
  runner has been removed.
* The `junit-platform-jfr` module which provided custom Java Flight Recorder (JFR) events
  for test discovery and execution has been removed. The functionality is now available
  directly in the `junit-platform-launcher` module.
* Support for Maven Surefire/Failsafe versions less than 3.0.0 has been removed.
* The following deprecated APIs have been removed:
  - `ReflectionSupport.loadClass(String)` method
  - `ReflectionUtils.readFieldValue(...)` methods
  - `ReflectionUtils.getMethod(...)` method
  - `BlacklistedExceptions` class
  - `PreconditionViolationException` class (from `org.junit.platform.commons.util`)
  - `ClasspathScanningSupport` class
  - `ConfigurationParameters.size()` method
  - `MethodSelector.getMethodParameterTypes()` method
  - `NestedMethodSelector.getMethodParameterTypes()` method
  - `ReportEntry()` constructor
  - `SingleTestExecutor` class
  - `LauncherDiscoveryRequestBuilder()` constructor
  - `LegacyReportingUtils` class
  - `TestPlan.add(TestIdentifier)`, `TestPlan.getChildren(String)`, and
    `TestPlan.getTestIdentifier(String)` methods
  - `@UseTechnicalNames` annotation for suites
  - `EngineTestKit.execute(String, EngineDiscoveryRequest)`,
    `EngineTestKit.execute(TestEngine, EngineDiscoveryRequest)`, and
    `EngineTestKit.Builder.filters(DiscoveryFilter...)` methods
* Support for "legacy semantics" for field and method searches that used to be
  configurable via the `junit.platform.reflection.search.useLegacySemantics` system
  property has been removed. JUnit now always adheres to standard Java semantics regarding
  whether a given field or method is visible or overridden according to the rules of the
  Java language.
* The type bounds of the following methods have been changed to be more flexible and allow
  nullable and non-nullable types:
  - `ConfigurationParameters.get(String, Function)`
  - `NamespacedHierarchicalStore.getOrComputeIfAbsent(N, K, Function)`
  - `NamespacedHierarchicalStore.getOrComputeIfAbsent(N, K, Function, Class)`
* The `junit-platform-suite-commons` module has been removed. Its functionality is now
  integrated directly in the `junit-platform-suite` module.
* `ConversionSupport` now converts `String` to `Locale` using the IETF BCP 47 language tag
  format supported by the `Locale.forLanguageTag(String)` factory method instead of the
  format used by the deprecated `Locale(String)` constructor.
* All `getOrComputeIfAbsent(...)` methods in `NamespacedHierarchicalStore` have been
  deprecated in favor of the new `computeIfAbsent(...)` methods.
* Setting an invalid value for one of the following enum-based configuration parameters
  now causes test discovery to fail:
  - `junit.platform.discovery.issue.failure.phase`
  - `junit.platform.discovery.issue.severity.critical`
* The methods `findNestedClasses(...)` and `streamNestedClasses(...)` in
  `ReflectionSupport` now return nested classes, which are declared in the same enclosing
  class or interface, ordered in a deterministic but intentionally nonobvious way.
* Serialization support for `TestIdentifier` has been changed in a backwards-incompatible
  way in order to simplify the implementation.

[[release-notes-6.0.0-junit-platform-new-features-and-improvements]]
==== New Features and Improvements

* New `Launcher.execute({LauncherExecutionRequest})` API with corresponding
  `{LauncherExecutionRequestBuilder}` to enable the addition of parameters to test
  executions in the future without additional overloads of `execute(...)`.
* New `discoveryRequest()` method in `{LauncherDiscoveryRequestBuilder}` (analogous to
  `executionRequest(...)` in `{LauncherExecutionRequestBuilder}`), which is an alias for
  the existing `request()` method and is intended to be used via a `static` import.
* New `LauncherDiscoveryRequestBuilder.forExecution()` method which serves as a
  convenience for constructing a `{LauncherExecutionRequest}` that contains a
  `{LauncherDiscoveryRequest}`.
* New `selectClasses(...)` and `selectClassesByName(...)` factory methods have been
  introduced in `{DiscoverySelectors}` to simplify use cases where one needs to select
  multiple individual test classes for the `Launcher` or `EngineTestKit`.
* New `selectors(List)` builder method for `{EngineTestKit}` which can be used in
  conjunction with the new `selectClasses(...)` and `selectClassesByName(...)` factory
  methods in `DiscoverySelectors`.
* New support for cancelling a running test execution via a `{CancellationToken}` passed
  to the `{Launcher}` as part of a `{LauncherExecutionRequest}` and from there to all
  registered test engines. Please refer to the
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#launcher-api-launcher-cancellation, User Guide>> for details
  and a usage example.
* Passing the `--fail-fast` option to the `execute` subcommand of the `ConsoleLauncher`
  now causes test execution to be cancelled after the first failed test.
* Cancellation support for implementations of `{HierarchicalTestEngine}` such as JUnit
  Jupiter, Spock, and Cucumber.
* Cancellation support for the `@Suite` test engine.
* New `TestTask.getTestDescriptor()` method for use in `HierarchicalTestExecutorService`
  implementations.
* New `computeIfAbsent(...)` methods in `NamespacedHierarchicalStore` to simplify working
  with non-nullable types.
* Convention-based conversion in `ConversionSupport` now supports factory methods and
  factory constructors that accept a single `CharSequence` argument in addition to the
  existing support for factories that accept a single `String` argument.
* Non-printable control characters in display names are now replaced with alternative
  representations. For example, `\n` is replaced with `<LF>`. This applies to all display
  names in JUnit Jupiter, `@SuiteDisplayName`, and any other test engines that subclass
  `AbstractTestDescriptor`. Please refer to the
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-display-names, User Guide>> for details.
* Stack traces are now pruned up to the test method or lifecycle method.


[[release-notes-6.0.0-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

[[release-notes-6.0.0-junit-jupiter-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* CSV headers are now properly supported with the default display name pattern and the
  explicit `+{argumentsWithNames}+` display name pattern for parameterized tests that
  utilize the `useHeadersInDisplayName` flag in `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource`.
  Specifically, the parameter name is no longer duplicated in the display name when a CSV
  header is desired instead.

[[release-notes-6.0.0-junit-jupiter-deprecations-and-breaking-changes]]
==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The following deprecated APIs have been removed:
  - `MethodOrderer.Alphanumeric` class
  - `InvocationInterceptor.interceptDynamicTest(Invocation, ExtensionContext)` method
* The deprecated `junit.jupiter.tempdir.scope` configuration parameter is no longer
  supported.
* The `JRE` enum constants for `JAVA_8` to `JAVA_16` have been deprecated because they can
  no longer be used at runtime since `JAVA_17` is the new baseline. Please also manually
  update any values used with the `minVersion` and `maxVersion` attributes in
  `@EnabledForJreRange` and `@DisabledForJreRange` or the `versions` attributes in
  `@EnabledOnJre` and `@DisabledOnJre` to ensure that you are no longer declaring version
  values less than 17.
* `@EnabledForJreRange` and `@DisabledForJreRange` now use `JAVA_17` as their default
  `min` value.
* For consistency with test methods, `@Nested` classes declared in the same enclosing
  class or interface are now ordered in a deterministic but intentionally nonobvious
  way.
* The `junit-jupiter-migrationsupport` module and its contained classes are now
  deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.
* As a result of migrating from
  https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers[univocity-parsers] to
  https://fastcsv.org/[FastCSV] for `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource`, root causes and
  messages of exceptions thrown for malformed CSV input may differ in some cases. While
  the overall parsing behavior remains consistent, this may affect custom error handling
  that relies on specific exception types or messages.
* The `lineSeparator` attribute in `@CsvFileSource` has been removed. The line separator
  is now automatically detected, meaning that any of `\r`, `\n`, or `\r\n` is treated as a
  line separator.
* Attributes such as `ignoreLeadingAndTrailingWhitespace`, `nullValues`, and others in
  `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource` now apply to header fields as well as to regular
  fields.
* Extra characters after a closing quote are no longer allowed in `@CsvSource` and
  `@CsvFileSource`. For example, if a single quote is used as the quote character,
  the following CSV value `'foo'INVALID,'bar'` will now cause an exception to be thrown.
  This helps ensure that malformed input is not silently accepted or misinterpreted.
* Support for the `junit.jupiter.params.arguments.conversion.locale.format` configuration
  parameter has been removed. `Locale` conversions are now always performed using the IETF
  BCP 47 language tag format supported by the `Locale.forLanguageTag(String)` factory
  method.
* The return type of the `provideTestTemplateInvocationContexts(ExtensionContext)` method
  in the `TestTemplateInvocationContextProvider` interface has been changed from
  `Stream<TestTemplateInvocationContext>` to
  `Stream<?{nbsp}extends{nbsp}TestTemplateInvocationContext>`.
* The type bounds of the following methods have been changed to be more flexible and allow
  nullable and non-nullable types:
  - `ExtensionContext.getConfigurationParameter(String, Function)`
  - `ExtensionContext.getOrComputeIfAbsent(K, Function)`
  - `ExtensionContext.getOrComputeIfAbsent(K, Function, Class)`
* All `getOrComputeIfAbsent(...)` methods in `ExtensionContext.Store` are now deprecated
  in favor of the new `computeIfAbsent(...)` methods.
* Setting an invalid value for one of the following enum-based configuration parameters
  now causes test discovery or execution to fail:
  - `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default`
  - `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default`
  - `junit.jupiter.execution.timeout.mode`
  - `junit.jupiter.execution.timeout.thread.mode.default`
  - `junit.jupiter.extensions.testinstantiation.extensioncontextscope.default`
  - `junit.jupiter.tempdir.cleanup.mode.default`
  - `junit.jupiter.testinstance.lifecycle.default`
* The contracts for `Executable` parameters of Kotlin-specific `assertTimeout` functions
  have been changed from `callsInPlace(executable, EXACTLY_ONCE)` to
  `callsInPlace(executable, AT_MOST_ONCE)` which might result in compilation errors.

[[release-notes-6.0.0-junit-jupiter-new-features-and-improvements]]
==== New Features and Improvements

* Non-printable control characters in display names are now replaced with alternative
  representations. Please refer to the
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-display-names, User Guide>> for details.
* For consistency with `@TestClassOrder`, `@TestMethodOrder` annotations specified on a
  test class are now inherited by its `@Nested` inner classes, recursively.
* New `MethodOrderer.Default` and `ClassOrderer.Default` types for reverting back to
  default ordering on a `@Nested` class and its `@Nested` inner classes when an enclosing
  class specifies a different orderer via `@TestMethodOrder` or `@TestClassOrder`,
  respectively.
* The implementation of `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource` has been migrated from the no
  longer maintained https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers[univocity-parsers] to
  https://fastcsv.org/[FastCSV]. This improves the consistency of CSV input handling,
  especially for malformed entries, and provides better error reporting and overall
  performance.
* Display names for `@ParameterizedClass` and `@ParameterizedTest` now consistently style
  name-value pairs for arguments using `name = value` formatting – for example,
  `fruit{nbsp}={nbsp}apple` instead of `fruit=apple`.
* Text-based arguments in display names for parameterized tests are now quoted by default.
  In addition, special characters are escaped within quoted text. Please refer to the
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-display-names-quoted-text,
  User Guide>> for details.
* <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-argument-conversion-implicit-fallback,
  Fallback String-to-Object Conversion>> for parameterized tests now supports factory
  methods and factory constructors that accept a single `CharSequence` argument in
  addition to the existing support for factories that accept a single `String` argument.
* The `Arguments` interface for parameterized tests is now officially a
  `@FunctionalInterface`.
* Kotlin's `suspend` modifier may now be applied to test and lifecycle methods.
* New `computeIfAbsent(...)` methods in `ExtensionContext.Store` to simplify working
  with non-nullable types.
* Reason strings supplied to `ConditionEvaluationResult` APIs are now officially declared
  as `@Nullable`.


[[release-notes-6.0.0-junit-vintage]]
=== JUnit Vintage

[[release-notes-6.0.0-junit-vintage-deprecations-and-breaking-changes]]
==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The JUnit Vintage test engine is now deprecated and will report an INFO level discovery
  issue if it finds at least one JUnit 4 test class. The deprecation warning is intended
  to clarify the purpose of the engine: it should only be used temporarily while migrating
  tests to JUnit Jupiter or another testing framework with native JUnit Platform support.

[[release-notes-6.0.0-junit-vintage-new-features-and-improvements]]
==== New Features and Improvements

* Cancellation support for the Vintage test engine.
